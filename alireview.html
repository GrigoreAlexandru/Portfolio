                                Alireview was born out of the need of good and trustful reviews of Chinese products . Chinese products have a bad reputation , infamous for their knockoffs and low quality materials . A lot of people don't know a good part of electronics and semiconductor fabrications happens in china. Big brands like Intel, Apple, Samsung, etc have fabs in China or outsource from China. Why China ? Because China has already the needed infrastructure and labourers are cheap, which in turn fueled the bad reputation.But it's not always like that , for a while now pure Chinese brands have proven the western market that they can do it better and cheaper, just look at brands like One Plus, Huawei, Xiaomi, Lenovo and so many more.

                                Aliexpress is a ecommerce website owned by the giant Alibaba group. On Aliexpress you can find a variety of Chinese products sold by the producers themselves or by a middleman.Sure Aliexpress has it's own reviews but how trusty are they ? And so Alireview comes in handy , a community driven website where you can review , comment and vote products bought by real people . Looking to buy something ? Just search it on Aliereview and read the reviews . Bought a new Chinese product ? Add it on Alireview and write a review for it telling us how much you loved it .

                                Alireview.ga was my first Laravel project which left a big impact on me . I don't know why I didn't use it earlier .Laravel is very elegant and clean, can't imagine going back to codeigniter or simple php. That being said , Alireview is a simple Laravel project, it has crud functionality and user auth. When adding items the user only has to enter the item url from Aliexpress.com and write the review . Data is collected by a DOMparser, sadly Aliexpress api is only available through the affiliate program but as it turned out the domparser was a way easier way to implement data gathering. Once the item is created and stored in the database , users can then comment and write their own reviews through Disqus . Disqus was a much easier and cleaner option instead of a proprietary comment system, the item voting system is however proprietary.
